Stipules greenish, interpetiolar, connate, oblong-ovate or oblong, 10-20 mm, herbaceous, 10-20-ribbed, puberulent, with cystoliths, apex obtuse, petiole 2-8 cm; leaf blade dark greenish or greenish, broadly ovate, elliptic, 5-angled, or suborbicular in outline, 5-15*3-14 cm, submembranous or herbaceous, 5-veined, lateral basal veins reaching distal lobes, secondary veins 3-6 each side, adaxial surface sparsely armed with stinging and setulose hairs, abaxial surface densely light greenish pubescent and with stinging hairs on veins, base truncate or cordate, margin shallowly 5-7-lobed or palmately 3-lobed (irregularly 2-4-lobed again), lobes gradually enlarged distally, deltoid or oblong, 1-5 cm, dentate-serrulate, apex acuminate or acute; cystoliths botuliform or subpunctiform on both surfaces. Inflorescences unisexual, male inflorescences usually in proximal axils, paniculate with a few branches or sometimes subspicate, to 10 cm, longer than petioles; female ones in distal axils. Male flowers pedicellate, in bud ca. 1.4 mm; perianth lobes connate below middle, sparsely puberulent. Female perianth lobes connate at base, dorsal-ventral lobes suborbicular, setulose, lateral lobes suborbicular, ca. 4 times as short as dorsal ones. Achene light brownish, broadly ovoid or subglobose, slightly compressed, ca. 1 mm, conspicuously verrucose, invested by persistent perianth lobes. Fl. Jul-Oct, fr. Sep-Nov.
